# Top-down multiplayer game

A simple game I'm working on

This project is being made using Unity Engine, using FishNetworking as its multiplayer solution

Currently there are 2 modes, 4 maps, 3 tank types, and 6 layer colors to choose from

## Known issues

-  ~~Turrets desync when using client side prediction~~ fixed

 - **End screen generates errors**
    - *These errors do not crash the game*
    
## To be added:

1. More tank types
2. More colorful maps (all maps currently use the same color palette
