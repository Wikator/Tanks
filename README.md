# Top-down multiplayer game

A simple game I'm working on

This project is being made using Unity Engine, using FishNetworking as its multiplayer solution

In Multiplayer, currently there are 5 modes, 7 maps, 3 tank types, and 6 player colors to choose from

Singleplayer features 2 modes.

## Known issues

- **End screen sometimes displays wrong results**

- **Perspective can mess up aim**

- **Firing you weapons as client is delayed**
    
## To be added:

1. More tank types and more game modes
2. Updated tanks models
    + All models are currently very simple, hard to tell apart  ~~and it sometimes is difficult to see where they are aiming~~
3. Improved ligthning
    + It is looking quite good already, but there are some places where it can improve
    + Light emmited from tanks especially can be improved, for some colors
4. Peer to peer connections and lobby
    + ~~Epic Online Services will be implemented~~ Steam was used instead
    + Players can join P2P games now, but only through invites
5. Cleaner UI
6. Rewards from singleplayer, like colors
7. Improved AI im singleplayer
